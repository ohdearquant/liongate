//! Concurrency trait definitions.
//!
//! This module defines the core traits for the concurrency system, which
//! is based on an actor model with message passing. The concurrency system
//! implements the concepts described in "Concurrent Plugin Lifecycle Management
//! in Capability-Secured Microkernels" research.
//!
//! # Concurrency Model
//!
//! The Lion microkernel uses a hybrid actor-based approach where:
//!
//! - Each plugin is an isolated actor with its own state
//! - Actors communicate through message passing, not shared memory
//! - The actor system provides supervision for fault tolerance
//! - Instance pooling is used for efficient resource utilization
